This bot is literally just designed to cooperate with Hyperz Basic Bot, you can use this
bot to ban all of randy's CURRENTLY LISTED account IDs from a server, aslong as this bot, and the
basic bot (by Itz-Hyperz on github) are both in that server!

How-To-Setup (Windows)

- Right-Click main.js then click "edit"

- Scroll to the bottom and put your bot token in the client.login('your-bot-token-goes-here')

- Open the UpdateBot.bat file (its fine if it isnt there, just skip this step)

- Open the StartBot.bat file


- Your bot SHOULD be online!

How-To-Setup (linux)

- sudo su
- chmod +x start-bot-linux.sh
- ./start-bot-linux.sh
